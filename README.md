# Whisper Dictation

**Note: This application is for macOS only.**

A macOS application that converts speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model running locally. Press the Globe/Function key to start recording, press it again to stop recording, transcribe, and paste text at your current cursor position.

## Features

- System tray (menu bar) application that runs in the background
- Global hotkey (Globe/Function key) to trigger dictation
- Transcribes speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model locally
- Automatically pastes transcribed text at your cursor position
- **NEW**: AI-powered text enhancement - when you have text selected, your voice becomes an instruction to modify that text using AWS Bedrock (Claude)
- Visual feedback with menu bar icon status

### AI Text Enhancement (New Feature)

When you have AWS Bedrock configured, you can use voice commands to modify selected text:

1. **Select text** in any application (highlight the text you want to modify)
2. **Press the Globe/Function key** to start recording
3. **Give a voice instruction** like:
   - "Make this more professional"
   - "Translate this to Spanish"
   - "Summarize this paragraph"
   - "Fix the grammar"
   - "Make this sound friendlier"
4. **Press the Globe/Function key again** to stop recording
5. The selected text will be **automatically replaced** with the AI-enhanced version

**Note**: If no text is selected, the app behaves normally and just inserts the transcribed text.

You can also interact with the app through the menu bar icon:
- Click "Start/Stop Listening" to toggle recording
